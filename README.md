## G'day, I'm Luke Peterson 👋

I love to build things.  Here, you can find some of the things I've built. 🔨

I recently built [an Intel 8080 CPU emulator](https://github.com/lukepeterson/go8080cpu) and [assembler](https://github.com/lukepeterson/go8080assembler), but [I also build massive modular synthesisers](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJYOGeJjJWZ/?img_index=1), [do a lot of 3D printing](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSWN2uPJ3Rz/), [build robots](https://www.instagram.com/p/CT6YvjtpIe4/?img_index=1), and [have a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MachiningImpossible) where [I build an Enigma Machine in my workshop](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrLRX20rK3I/).

**I'm currently on the lookout for a Platform Engineer / Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) role, fully remote, based in Australia.**
